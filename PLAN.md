# Plan

## Base

* Front page: Navbar for site sections? Maybe some blocks?
    * Hero is required of course, this is a WEB TWO POINT OH site after all
    * Should have some of the blog posts on it, maybe some of the recipes
* Look into template partials
* Finish setting up Whitenoise

## Blog

* Front page
* Post editor/creator
* Tags
* Modern layout, header images
* Nice-to-have: reading time estimate, reading progress bar, table of contents

## Portfolio

TBD

## Recipes

TBD, blog first
